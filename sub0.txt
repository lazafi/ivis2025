Visualizing data is what first drew me to data science. I find the process of iteratively exploring datasets to uncover insights incredibly exciting. While statistical methods are valuable for analysis, it’s the visualization of complex patterns within the data that truly captures people’s attention. Taking this a step further, interactive visualizations empower users and customers—rather than just data scientists—to engage directly with the data and explore it on their own initiative. Learning how to create such interactive visualizations is my main motivation for taking this course.
